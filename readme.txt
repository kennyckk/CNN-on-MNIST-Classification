One of the deep neural network application practice on my machine learning course.
This is to use a Covolutional Neural Network Structure to Classify the MNist Dataset on Pytorch framework.

The code run with python 3.7.13 and below packages:

pytorch 1.21.1 	 	py3.7_cuda11.6_cudnn8_0
torchvision 0.13.1	
matplotlib 3.5.2
